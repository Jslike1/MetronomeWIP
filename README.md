# MetronomeWIP

This metronome application is a proof-of-concept designed to include unique features such as customizable musical segment reps,
and automatic tempo increase between repetitions. Currently supports simple time signatures and tempos up to around 250BPM (depending
on user's processing power). Automatic tempo increase not implemented as of last commit.
